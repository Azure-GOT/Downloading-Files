# Create VNet peering between two virtual netwoks

## Lab scenario

We can use VNet Peering between two virtual networks when we want to route traffic between them privately through IPv4 addresses. The virtual machines in the peered network uses Microsoft backbone infrastructure for communication.

## Objective

Here we will learn how to add peering between two virtual networks

# Instruction

- You should have two virtual netwoks created in azure for VNet peering

> Note: If the virtual networks are in different regions, the VNet peering will work.
